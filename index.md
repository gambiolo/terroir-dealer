## Experimenting with the trouble

### Terroir: French term used to describe the environmental factors that affects a crop’s phenotype, including unique environment contexts, such as soil practices and a crop’s specific growth habitat.

Terroir dealer came out during first lock down in the verry conservative area of ST Tropez. It started as an experiment to grow hemp fiber in specific soils (acid/neutral) and see how the hemp fiber changes depending on its soil structure. WIth the fiber you can build house and we organised a workshop around that idea, a house made of mud and hemp fiber. 

Why? When you are born in St Tropez you have 3 choices to live there: 

-1 you prostitue yourself to the libidinal destructive local economy  

-2 you squat inna caravan in the forest illegaly.

-3 you have wealthy heritage


Growing hemp in the south of France is easy as it doesnt need much watering (especialy if you enriched your soil with carbon) 


.



At the exact same time when we seeded the hemp we also created a local radio where people could come and listen to music from all around the mediterranean (we even got our windows smashed once listening to [this](https://youtu.be/83oWy-iWzAM)) we also installed a private meshnet so people could come near the emitter to connect and download certain files that we preffer sharing only locally.

Some of the archives can be found on [Radio Flouka](https://scenearabia.com/Noise/online-arab-underground-stations-reviving-radio-culture-in-the-middle-east) under the name [TERROIR DEALER](https://soundcloud.com/search?q=terroir%20dealer).

As planned, something went wrong, Someone took photos of the lab grown hemp, the bisness of surveillance is a very juicy biz in french collonial history and of course we got arrested. not sure if it was about the music, the mushrooms (mycorhyze) the hemp, or the crystals (Alun stones) they found, but they decided it wa alls illegal, and somehow we played along that narrative:)


### We went on a trial journey for detaining ''stupefiant'' in the midst of a pandemic. The judge asked why?

So we just showed her HOW we do with WHAT we have > here a prototype of a Hammam made of hemp and mud...no Beton, no ciment, a piece of collective art and an illegal shellterre somehow
