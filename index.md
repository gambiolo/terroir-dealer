## Experiencing with the trouble

### Terroir: French term used to describe the environmental factors that affects a crop’s phenotype, including unique environment contexts, such as soil practices and a crop’s specific growth habitat.

Terroir dealer came out during first lock down in the verry conservative area of ST Tropez. It started as an experiment to grow hemp fiber in specific soils (acid/neutral) and see how the hemp fiber changes depending on its soil structure. With hemp fiber you can actualy build healthy habitat and the goal was to organise a workshop around that idea, a house made of mud and hemp fiber. Then lockdown happened and the world changed.

Why building hemp fiber house in St Tropez? because if you are born locally we have 3 choices

-1  prostitue yourself to the libidinal destructive consumer ideology  

-2  squat inna caravan in the forest illegaly.

-3  have wealthy heritage


Growing hemp in the south of France is easy as it doesnt need much watering (especialy if you enrich your soil with carbon, also forests are burning dont you know?) it could help loads of people in need of autonomy, regenerate soils killed by intensive grappe growing. Finally building with local hemp fiber is the least destructive way to make yourself a home and avoid prostitution, wich is verry common in St Tropez.

At the exact same time when we seeded the hemp we also created a local radio where people could come and listen to music from all around the mediterranean coast (we even got our windows smashed once listening to [this](https://youtu.be/83oWy-iWzAM) syrian beats) There was also a private meshnet installed so people could come near the emitter and connect to download files locally.

As planned, something went wrong, someone snitched on us to the 'gendarme de st tropez'. If you are in the bisness of surveillance in France you'll know about french ideology... not sure if it also was about the arab music played loud, the mushrooms indoor growing (tobacco mycorhyze) the hemp, or the crystals (Alun stones), but they decided it wa alls illegal, and somehow we played along that narrative


### We went on a trial for detaining ''stupefiant'' in the midst of a pandemic. The judge asked why?

So we just showed her HOW we do with WHAT we have > here is the prototype of a Hammam made of hemp and mud...no Beton, no ciment, a piece of collective art and an illegal shellterre somehow, we can build more of these.

underdosing from our [St Tropez situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwD7FTk4Aos) with love (american flag missing from the picture) Of course the judge was sorry about this and she asked us if we had an internship for her daughter that studies architecture.
