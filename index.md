## Experiencing with the trouble

### Terroir: French term used to describe the environmental factors that affects a crop’s phenotype, including unique environment contexts, such as soil practices and a crop’s specific growth habitat.

Terroir dealer came out during first lock down in the verry conservative area of ST Tropez. It started as an experiment to grow hemp fiber in specific soils (acid/neutral) and see how the hemp fiber changes depending on its soil structure. (We specifically used fermented carbon biochar from our own recipies the results are the best results so far in term of nutrients). Now with hemp fiber you can actualy build healthy habitat and the goal was to organise workshops around that idea and build a hammam, and we did near Toulouse.

When we seeded the plants we also created a local radio where people could come and listen to mediterranean music (we even got our windows smashed once listening to [this](https://youtu.be/83oWy-iWzAM) syrian beats) There was also a private meshnet installed so people could come near the emitter and connect to download files locally.

Some of the archives can be found on [Radio Flouka](https://scenearabia.com/Noise/online-arab-underground-stations-reviving-radio-culture-in-the-middle-east) under the name [TERROIR DEALER](https://soundcloud.com/search?q=terroir%20dealer).

As planned, someone snitched on us, the bisness of surveillance in France never ends. Not sure if it was about the arab music played loud? the mushrooms indoor growing (tobacco mycorhyze)? the hemp? or the crystals (Alun stones)? but they decided it was all illegal, and somehow we played along that narrative.


### We went on a trial for detaining ''stupefiant'' in the midst of a pandemic, getting kicked out from our lab. The judge asked why we did this?

So we just showed her HOW we do with WHAT we have > here is the prototype of a Hammam made of hemp and mud...no Beton, no ciment, a piece of collective art but verry illegal shelter...and we can build more of these.

underdosing from our [St Tropez situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwD7FTk4Aos) with love (american flag missing from the picture) Of course the judge was sorry about this and she asked us if we had an internship for her daughter that studies architecture:)
